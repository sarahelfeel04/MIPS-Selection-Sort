# Project: MIPS Array Manipulation Procedures

This repository contains the implementation of MIPS assembly procedures to perform various operations on an array of student grades. The procedures implemented in this project include sorting the array using the Selection Sort algorithm, finding the maximum grade, and identifying students eligible for a semester abroad based on their grades.

## Selection Sort - Sel_Sort
The procedure `Sel_Sort` takes as input the address of the first element of an array and the number of elements in the array. It sorts the array using the Selection Sort algorithm, arranging the elements in ascending order.

### Usage
1. Load the address of the first element of the array into a register (`$a0`).
2. Load the number of elements in the array into a register (`$a1`).
3. Call the `Sel_Sort` procedure.

```assembly
# Example Usage
la $a0, array    # Load address of the first element of the array
li $a1, size     # Load number of elements in the array
jal Sel_Sort     # Call Sel_Sort procedure
```

## Top Rank - Top_rank
The procedure `Top_rank` takes as input the address of the first element of an array and the number of elements in the array. It returns the maximum grade present in the array.

### Usage
1. Load the address of the first element of the array into a register (`$a0`).
2. Load the number of elements in the array into a register (`$a1`).
3. Call the `Top_rank` procedure.

```assembly
# Example Usage
la $a0, array    # Load address of the first element of the array
li $a1, size     # Load number of elements in the array
jal Top_rank     # Call Top_rank procedure
```

## Semester Abroad Eligibility - Sem_abroad
The procedure `Sem_abroad` takes as input the address of the first element of an array and the number of elements in the array. It identifies students who are eligible for a semester abroad based on their grades (70% or more) and returns an array of their grades along with the number of eligible students.

### Usage
1. Load the address of the first element of the array into a register (`$a0`).
2. Load the number of elements in the array into a register (`$a1`).
3. Call the `Sem_abroad` procedure.
4. The procedure returns the address of the eligible students' grades array in register `$v0` and the number of eligible students in register `$v1`.

```assembly
# Example Usage
la $a0, array    # Load address of the first element of the array
li $a1, size     # Load number of elements in the array
jal Sem_abroad   # Call Sem_abroad procedure
```

## My implementation

Sure, here's a summarized version of the information you provided:

**1. Selection Sort**
- Input: Base address of the array in $a0, Number of elements in $a1.
- Description: Sorts the array in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm. It iterates through the array and swaps elements to arrange them properly.
- Output: The sorted array is stored in memory; no values are returned in $v0 or $v1.

**2. Finding Top Rank**
**Version 1: Top_Rank**
- Input: Base address of the array in $a0, Number of elements in $a1.
- Description: Scans the unsorted array to find the maximum value present in it.
- Output: The maximum value is returned in $v0.

**Version 2: Top_Rank_V2**
- Input: Base address of the array in $a0, Number of elements in $a1.
- Description: Assumes the array is sorted and directly returns the value of the last element.
- Output: The value of the last element is returned in $v0.

**3. Semester Abroad**
- Input: Base address of the array in $a0, Number of elements in $a1.
- Description: Identifies values in the array that are greater than or equal to 70, representing students eligible for a semester abroad.
- Output: The base address of a new array containing eligible students' grades is returned in $v0. The number of eligible students is returned in $v1.
